##Concentration Game

I created this game in OOP paradigm, it is all based off one Constructor "Gameboard" with added properties and abilities.

You click on a tile one at a time to achieve two matching tiles. However, there are currently unsolved errors. So the game is a bit buggy.

####Bugs
  1. Click tracking
  2. prevent over clicks
  3. better end menu systems
  4. Correct CSS styles
Clicking one at a time achieves best results, and not clicking on a flipped tile again.

It is not a two player game. Concentration is not a game to switch between two players. It could be done with two boards that switch, but that would be clunky and not fun. We need funs.
