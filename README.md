##Concentration Game

I created this game in OOP paradigm, it is all based off one Constructor "Gameboard" with added properties and abilities.

You click on a tile one at a time to achieve two matching tiles. However, there are currently unsolved errors. So the game is a bit buggy.

Clicking one at a time achieves best results, and not clicking on a flipped tile again.
